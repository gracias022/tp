### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

</div>

<div class="section-spacing">

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `OrderListPanel`,`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

</div>

<div class="section-spacing">

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the user input is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. When the command is executed, it can communicate with the `Model` (e.g., to delete a person and all his/her orders).<br>
   For readability, the diagram omits preliminary interactions with the `Model` that occur before the delete operations (e.g., retrieving the currently displayed list of persons).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `EditOrderCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

</div>

<div class="section-spacing">

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data: This includes all `Person` objects (contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Order` objects (contained in a `OrderList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects and `Order` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Order>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

</div>

<div class="section-spacing">

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

</div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div class="section-spacing">

### Order management

The `Model` component manages `Order` entities using an `OrderList`, which stores all orders in the address book. Each `Order` records the customer’s `UUID` rather than holding a direct reference to a `Person` object. `Person` objects are replaced wholesale when edited, so storing a reference would become outdated. Using `UUID` keeps orders stable and avoids cascading updates when customer details change.

An `Order` stores the following fields:
* Customer’s `UUID`
* `Item`
* `Quantity`
* `DeliveryTime`
* `Address`
* `Status`

These fields (except the customer’s `UUID`) are implemented as domain classes, allowing each to encapsulate its own validation and formatting logic. Optional fields, `Address` and `Status`, allow the system to fall back to the customer’s saved address or a default status when these values are not provided by the user.

`OrderList` wraps an internal `ObservableList<Order>`, ensuring that UI components automatically update whenever orders are added or modified. This design integrates the new `Order` entity into the existing model while minimizing coupling.

</div>

<div class="section-spacing">

### Editing data feature (`edit` and `edit-o`)

BZNUS supports editing both customer details and order details through separate commands:

* Edit customer: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [ig/INSTAGRAM] [fb/FACEBOOK] [a/ADDRESS] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]...`
* Edit order: `edit-o ORDER_INDEX [i/ITEM_NAME] [q/QUANTITY] [at/DATE] [a/DELIVERY_ADDRESS] [s/STATUS]`

Both commands follow the same architecture pattern: **parse → validate → execute → commit → UI refresh**.

#### Edit customer command (`edit`)

The edit command updates fields of the customer at `INDEX` in the currently displayed customer list. At least one field must be provided.

##### Implementation Overview

1. `AddressBookParser` routes `edit` input to `EditCommandParser`.
2. `EditCommandParser` parses index and optional prefixed fields into an `EditPersonDescriptor`.
3. `EditCommand#execute(Model model)`: 
    * resolves target customer from `model.getFilteredPersonList()`,
    * applies descriptor updates to construct an edited `Person`,
    * replaces original person in model,
    * commits state and returns success message.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditCustomerSequenceDiagram" />

##### Validation Highlights

* Index must be valid in filtered customer list.
* At least one field must be edited.
* Edited customer must still satisfy basic requirements(e.g., required contact constraints, no duplicate conflicting identity rules)

#### Edit order command (`edit-o`)

##### Implementation Overview

1. `AddressBookParser` routes `edit-o` input to `EditOrderCommandParser`.
2. `EditOrderCommandParser` parses index and optional order fields into an `EditOrderDescriptor`.
3.  `EditOrderCommand#execute(Model model)`:
    * resolves target order from `model.getFilteredOrderList()`,
    * applies descriptor updates to construct an edited `Order`,
    * replaces original order in model,
    * commits state and returns success message.

<puml src="diagrams/EditOrderSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditOrderSequenceDiagram" />

##### Validation Highlights

* Order index must be valid in filtered order list.
* At least one order field must be provided.
* New values must pass field-level validation.

</div>

<div class="section-spacing">

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

<div class="section-spacing">

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is a home-based food and beverage (F&B) business owner
* has a need to manage a significant number of customer contacts from multiple messaging platforms, complex dietary requirements, and food orders with varying deadlines
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI (Command Line Interface) apps

**Value proposition**: Manage customer profiles and track food orders significantly faster than a typical mouse/GUI-driven app.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is `BZNUS` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**Use case: UC01 - Add Customer**

**Guarantees:**
* If the command succeeds, exactly one new customer with a unique name is added to the system.
* If the command fails at any point, no customer is added and the system state remains unchanged.

**MSS:**

1. User enters the add customer command with a name and any optional fields (e.g. contact details, remark, tags).

2. BZNUS validates the input.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Portability Requirements
1. The system should work on any _mainstream OS_ with Java `17` or above installed. Users should not need to install additional runtime dependencies.

#### Performance Requirements
1. The system should support up to **1000 customers** and **5000 orders** without noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
2. For all valid commands, results should be displayed within **2 seconds** of submitting the command.

#### Scalability Requirements
1. The system should allow future addition of features such as data archiving and undo/redo without requiring major refactoring of existing code.
2. The system should allow future support for additional contact fields and order details (e.g. Telegram handle, delivery instructions) without requiring major refactoring of existing code.

#### Usability Requirements
1. A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using mouse-driven interactions.
2. The interface should be intuitive enough that a home-based F&B seller with basic computer literacy can use the system without requiring extensive training.
3. Error messages should clearly describe the issue detected and, where practical, suggest how to correct it.

#### Reliability Requirements
1. The system should handle invalid user inputs gracefully by showing clear error messages instead of crashing.
2. The system must not corrupt or partially update customer or order data in the event of an invalid command or unexpected failure.
3. All changes to customer and order data should be saved to disk immediately after a successful data-modifying command.

#### Data Requirements
1. All customer and order data should be stored locally in a human-editable JSON file.
2. The storage format should remain readable in a standard text editor at the maximum expected data size (1000 customers, 5000 orders).

#### Security & Privacy Requirements
1. The system should not transmit customer or order data to external services during normal operation. Customer data should remain on the user's local machine unless the user explicitly copies or shares the data file.
2. The system should fail safely on corrupted storage data (e.g. recover to a safe state) instead of executing undefined behavior.

#### Testability Requirements
1. Core logic (parsing, command execution, and model updates) should be testable without launching the GUI.
2. Command outcomes should be deterministic for the same input and initial state, enabling reliable automated tests.

#### Maintainability Requirements
1. The codebase should be organized in a modular fashion with clear separation of concerns (e.g. UI, logic, model, storage) to facilitate future enhancements and debugging.
2. The codebase should follow a consistent coding style (e.g. Java coding conventions) to support easy onboarding of new contributors.

#### Constraints
1. The system should be a standalone desktop application and must not depend on a remote server or external database.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Add non-blocking warnings for duplicate contact details**: Currently, BZNUS only checks for duplicate customer names. As a result, users may accidentally create duplicate entries for the same customer with the same phone number or social media handle. We plan to display a non-blocking warning when a new or edited customer shares the same phone number, Facebook username, or Instagram handle as existing customer(s). The warning will highlight the matching contact fields and may list customers with overlapping details to help users decide whether the new or edited entry is intentional. This helps users spot potential duplicates early without blocking legitimate entries (e.g. shared contact details among family members or corporate customers).

2. **Allow editing of the customer linked to an existing order**: Currently, once an order is created, the customer associated with it cannot be changed. This is inconvenient when a user accidentally selects the wrong customer. We plan to extend the edit order command to support updating the customer the order is linked to. The system will validate that the new customer exists and update the order accordingly. This enhancement addresses the flaw where users must delete and recreate an order to correct a customer assignment.

3. **Add a confirmation step before deleting a customer or an order**: Deleting a customer or an order currently executes immediately, which increases the risk of accidental data loss. We plan to introduce a confirmation prompt (e.g., “Are you sure you want to delete this customer? (yes/no)”). The command will only proceed if the user explicitly confirms. This enhancement prevents accidental deletions and improves data safety.

<div class="section-spacing">

## **Appendix: Effort**

Compared with AB3, BZNUS required substantially more effort because it extends a single-entity contact manager into a multi-entity system with linked `Customer` and `Order` workflows. The added complexity came from coordinating model design, validation, persistence, and UI updates across two related domains instead of one.

### Scope expansion and technical complexity

We implemented customer and order flows end-to-end (parse → validate → execute → persist → display). This involved refactoring AB3 classes and introducing new components such as command classes (e.g. `AddOrderCommand`, `DeleteOrderCommand`), parsers (e.g. `FindOrderCommandParser`), order-domain model classes (e.g. `DeliveryTime`, `OrderList`), storage adapters (e.g. `JsonAdaptedOrder`), and order-related UI components (e.g. `OrderCard`, `OrderListPanel`).

A key design challenge was maintaining customer-order referential integrity. We eventually adopted UUID-based linkage (`Person#getId()` and `Order#getCustomerId`) so that orders could be associated with customers without depending on displayed list indices. This supported important behaviours such as:

* cascading deletion of a customer's orders when the customer is deleted,
* adding an order that uses the customer's stored address when no delivery address is specified, while still failing safely if no address is found.

We also spent significant effort redesigning the UI to present customer and order information clearly in separate panels. Notably, we implemented a click-to-filter functionality, where selecting a customer card updates the order panel to show only that customer's orders.

### Main implementation challenges

The most effort-intensive parts of the project were:

* designing and maintaining customer-order relationships without breaking data consistency,
* enforcing stronger domain validation (e.g. optional-field constraints and contact-method rules),
* keeping command parsing and validation consistent across add/edit/delete/find operations for both entities,
* updating JSON storage so customers and orders could be saved and restored reliably,
* adjusting the UI to keep customer and order information readable and well-organised,
* writing and updating automated tests to cover boundary cases, invalid input, cross-entity interactions, and persistence behaviour,
* updating the User Guide (UG) and Developer Guide (DG) to provide clear instructions and documentation for our expanded feature set.

In addition to implementation work, we spent time coordinating developmental changes through the forking workflow, issue tracking, and thorough pull-request reviews. These helped us identify bugs early and avoid unintended side effects when multiple features touched shared components.

### Code Reuse

BZNUS reused AB3's architectural foundation, including its component structure, command workflow, parser style, JavaFX scaffold, and JSON-based storage approach. This reduced setup effort and allowed us to focus on BZNUS-specific features such as customer-order management, custom validation rules, and richer user-facing workflows.

We also reused AB3-supported libraries and tools, such as JavaFX, Jackson and JUnit. This avoided additional integration work and kept the project focused on domain logic.

### Achievements

Our key achievements include:

* **A complete multi-entity application**, with customer and order management integrated into a coherent CLI workflow,
* **A responsive and intuitive UI** that dynamically updates to show relevant customer and order information while maintaining readability and structure,
* **Helpful, user‑friendly error messages** that guide users toward correcting invalid inputs and reduce friction during command entry.
* **A maintainable and extensible codebase**, supported by modular design, clear separation of concerns, and well‑documented components.
* **Comprehensive automated testing**, covering validation rules, cross‑entity interactions, and persistence behaviour to ensure long-term code reliability.
* **Clear and user‑focused documentation**, with updated UG/DG sections, diagrams, and testing instructions that reflect the expanded feature set.
